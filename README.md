# webtar
webtar was forged in the fires of HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS. 
The app is a minimal environment with just enough features to enable the user to achieve the softwares main goal: 
Allow the user to interact with a file tree and export it as a Base64 Data URL available to use offline and without a file needed to launch. 

Tutorial on the software is here:

P.S. It’s been a little while since I finished this project, and in that time, the scope of what it enables has become clear to me (which I will NOT elaborate on here).
If you take this tool and use it for something harmful, I can only hope you get caught.
But given that this tool has zero dependencies (besides the web browser), and zero oversight when I wrote it, I honestly don’t know if you will.
Not to mention the potential of sharing it through tools commonly used inside companies, schools, etc.
Because of that, I will not make a Webtar export of Webtar (i.e., bootstrapping Webtar), or share it outside of this GitHub repo.
PLEASE ONLY make cool demos to show your friends and NOTHING ELSE—
or else, when you come home tonight, I will be under your bed.
